## About
Discord Reminder Bot is a Discord bot which keeps track of due dates in the [UVic Engineering & Computer Science Discord Server](https://discord.gg/uvicengr).

## Functionality
Discord Reminder Bot stores due dates and reminders. Due dates correspond with a course and can be added or viewed at any time in the course's text channel or in the bot-commands channel. When a user sets a reminder, they will be sent a private message at a certain date and time, with a course's upcoming due dates.

## Usage
The bot can be used in a course's text channel, math-200 for example, or in the bot-commands channel. Use the `$help` command to see the list of available commands to get started.
